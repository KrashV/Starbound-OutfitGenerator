# Starbound Outfit Generator

A tool that specializes in creating multiplayer compatible animated clothing. To achieve this, we're using [Nettle Boy's directives methods](http://ilovebacons.com/threads/guide-to-re-animating-clothes-with-json.12019/page-5#post-92288).

## Prerequisites

* [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=49981)

## Installation

Download and unpack the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-OutfitGenerator/releases) page.  
Make sure you download the Outfit Generator and not the source coude.

If you're updating to a newer version of the tool, simply overwrite all files when asked.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply download a template from the [templates](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-OutfitGenerator/tree/master/templates) folder and start spriting in your favourite image editor. It is highly recommended to save your spritesheet as a PNG file.  
If you already have one or more spritesheets, just use those instead.

Drag your spritesheet on top of the executable (`OutfitGenerator.exe`) and follow the instructions.  

Please note that when making custom sleeves, your two sleeve spritesheets (front and back) have to be merged. You can do so by dragging both files on the application.

If you're not quite sure what to do with the application, please see the [Usage](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-OutfitGenerator/wiki/Usage) section of the Wiki.
